## Changelog

__3.1.0__ _(September 11, 2018)_

* Updated the sample projects for the Apache Software License. This gives greater open source freedom with the NatNet redistributable.
* Included additional timing metrics and recording to the WinForms application.
* Updated the python depacketizer sample to match the correct rigid body descriptions.
* Updated the SampleClient and SampleClient3D projects, so that they may be used exclusively with unlabeled markers.
* Updated the explanation of labeled markers in the PacketClient.cpp to be more descriptive.
* Improved clarity of the version and compilation information for sample applications.
* Added a broadcast option to the multicast data channel.
* Fixed a crash when attempting to stream over 99 rigid bodies at one time.
* Fixed a crash with the WinForms test app by removing the ability to edit text in the IP address combo box.
* Fixed an issue where the labeled marker list did not report the flags when a labeled marker was occluded.
* Fixed a bug with automatically determining the IP address on start.
* Fixed a bug in the WinForms test app that caused it to report incorrect rigid body data in some cases.
* Fixed a bug in the WinForms test app where it would not refresh when switching between multicast and unicast.
* Renamed "Labeled Markers" to just "Markers" in the WinForms application.

__3.0.1__ _(November 7, 2017)_

* Added the ability to remotely configure Motive software settings from NatNet clients.
* Added an active marker ID property to marker data type to support new active markers over NatNet. Also, included active marker ID information in the rigid body marker descriptions.
* Reorganized the member methods of the NatNetClient class. Previous methods are still supported for this release; refer to NatNetClient.h for details. 
* Updated the sample applications, including the WinFormSamples app, to demonstrate the newly added features.
* Added RebroadcastMotiveData sample for streaming using serial port communication.
* Now includes pre-built sample applications for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications in the samples/bin directory.
* Added the ability to automatically discover Multicast/Unicast client. As a result, the ConnectionType Enum has been deprecated.
* Added an auto-detection feature for finding IP addresses of the available NatNet tracking server, improving the usability of several client applications.
* Added SampleClientML sample for demonstrating a basic use of the managed library.

* Added 'keep alive' streaming command to resolve issues with UDP unicast clients going to sleep.

Fixes

* Fixed issue where WinFormsTestApp crashed on exit.
* Fixed crash in WinFormsTestApp when streaming more than 44 rigid bodies.
* Fixed issue where WinFormsTestApp became non-responsive after selecting multiple items.

__2.8.0__ _(September 2, 2015)_

Features & Enhancements

* Added: Motive 1.8 streaming support
* Added: New MATLAB wrapper sample.
* Added: Add playback range and looping commands ("SetPlaybackStartFrame,frameNumber", "SetPlaybackStopFrame,frameNumber", "SetPlaybackLooping,0or1") to NatNet command list, and updated NatNet SDK Winforms and PacketClient samples to illustrate usage.

* Added: Updated Unity3D streaming sample to stream rigid bodies and skeletons.
* Added: Add Z-up quaternion to Euler decoding example to WinForms sample when streaming Z-up from Motive.
* Added: Add support and examples for explicitly disconnecting Unicast clients.
* Added: Add support for Z-up streaming, and update SampleClient 3D to illustrate usage.
* Changed: (NatNetML only) Change GetLastFrameOfData() routine in managed client to lock the frame and return a copy of the data (polling clients only). Update WinForms sample app to illustrate usage.
* Changed: (NatNetML only) Provide copy constructors to simplify .NET client data deep copy operations, and update Winforms sample with data copy operation.
* Changed: (NatNetML only) Fix graphing for correct frame alignment for Motive.
* Changed: (NatNetML only) Add timing testing operations and reporting.

Fixes

* Fixed: Fix for PointCloud solved bit indicator.

__2.7__ _(October 21, 2014)_

Features & Enhancements

* Motive 1.7 Streaming support
* New timing sample for validating mocap streaming frame timing.
